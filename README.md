#  Do You Want To See a Ghost?

Do You Want To See a Ghost is a toy app deonstrating usage of the now deprecated QC View to display a quartz composition. This app is only partially functioning and only exists for demonstration purposes. The original project was created in 2011.

## Known Issues

The Quartz Composition referenced in this app uses input from the device's camera to generate visual effects. Quartz Composer may now longer be allowed this type of hardware access, so the entitlement to use the camera is switched off. When switched on, starting the app will prompt the user to allow camera access but the composition fails to launch.
